# crusty-calculator
A learning project for building an interoperable Rust calculator

## Building

To build:
```bash
cargo build
```

To run:
```bash
cargo run
```

To check (faster than a build for debug information):
```bash
cargo check
```

To format (so it's all the same style):
```bash
cargo fmt
```
